# Mouse Position Handle Info

## About

MousePositionHandleInfo allows you to inspect Windows handles (HWND) while moving the mouse. This is helpful when Windows will disappear on user interaction / timeout, like notifications, where other tools fail to capture the handle information in time.

## How to

While the application is running, press and hold CTRL key on your keyboard while moving the mouse. Release the CTRL key to save the info displayed.
